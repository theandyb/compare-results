# Abstract

# Introduction

The goal of this (mini) project is to compare the results from running the [smaug-genetics](http://github.com/carjed/smaug-genetics) pipeline
on the same dataset. Numerical differences were observed in some of the outputs, and this likely resulted from the github repository being put together
after all the analyses had been run initially (likely multiple times per step and not necessarily in the order described in the repository's documentation).

Here in this analysis, we compare the results of the logistic regression models used to predict the mutation rates for each 7-mer mutation type, conditioned
on 14 genomic features (for more details, see the paper [Extremely rare variants reveal patterns of germline mutation rate heterogeneity in humans](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05936-5).
